## we have some null values to invetegate 

1 -!would be better to split PassangerID to get more info for those who was with eachother 
2- !!add col for has family or not maybe ?


for HomePlanet we might assume that eatheir there is another planet unmentioned or fill them with the last passanger planet 
as it be the case that they got in with each other 


!! for CryoSleep we might suggest that those who's missing probably aren't  in CryoSleep but will try both
